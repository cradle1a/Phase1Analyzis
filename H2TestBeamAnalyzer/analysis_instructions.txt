2. cmsenv
3. ./run_analysis.py [options]

Usage: run_analysis.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  --r=RUNS            Pick a specific run number or range of numbers with Unix
                      globbing - may need to use single quotes or -f before
                      running. NOTE - MUST USE 6 DIGIT RUN NUMBER, add leading
                      zeros as needed.
  -d                  Delete files after moving to destination
  --dest=DESTINATION  Destination directory for run results/html. Remote
                      locations ok
  --runDest=RUNDEST   Where the run files HTB*.root are to be stored during
                      processing. '.' for working directory, but will be
                      removed if '.' is used
  -v                  Runs the analysis in verbose mode. Not recommended on
                      large runs or batches of runs, as verbose output can be
                      quite massive.
  -q                  Further decreases verbosity.
  --all               Use --all to run on all files in spool
